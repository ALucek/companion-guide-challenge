Introduction to Tokenization in Large Language Models
------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to our exploration of tokenization in large language models (LLMs). Tokenization is a crucial, albeit complex, process that plays a foundational role in how LLMs understand and process text data. Despite its challenges, mastering tokenization is essential for anyone working with LLMs.

<img src="frames/frame_7.jpg" alt=" Now you see here that I have a sad face and that's because tokenization is my least favorite part" width="450"/>

### What is Tokenization?

Tokenization is the process of converting strings of text into sequences of tokens, which are smaller, manageable units of text for LLMs. This process involves creating a vocabulary of all unique characters or words in a dataset and assigning each a unique integer token.

### The Role of Embedding Tables

After tokenization, embedding tables come into play. These tables use the integer associated with each token as a lookup to extract a row of trainable parameters. These parameters, once trained, are what the transformer model uses to "understand" each token.

<img src="frames/frame_139.jpg" alt=" So here we had a very naive tokenization process that was a character level tokenizer" width="450"/>

### Beyond Character-Level Tokenization

While the initial example was a simple character-level tokenizer, state-of-the-art language models use more sophisticated methods for constructing token vocabularies. One such method is byte pair encoding (BPE), which we will delve into, demonstrating its application and significance in tokenization for LLMs.

### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)

BPE is a method used to construct character chunks for token vocabularies, moving beyond simple character-level tokenization. This algorithm plays a crucial role in how modern LLMs, like GPT-2, handle tokenization, allowing for a more efficient and nuanced understanding of text.

### Tokenization's Impact on Language Model Performance

Tokenization is not just a technical detail; it significantly impacts the performance of LLMs. Issues such as difficulty with spelling tasks, simple string processing, handling non-English languages, and even simple arithmetic can often be traced back to tokenization strategies.

### Exploring Tokenization with Live Examples

To better understand tokenization's effects, we explore live examples using a web app that allows for real-time tokenization in your browser. This demonstration highlights how tokenization can vary significantly based on the context, language, and even formatting of the text.

<img src="frames/frame_365.jpg" alt=" So I have it loaded here and what I like about this web app is that tokenization is running a sort of live in your browser in JavaScript" width="450"/>

### Tokenization and Non-English Languages

The tokenization process can disproportionately affect non-English languages, often resulting in a higher number of tokens for the same content when compared to English. This discrepancy can lead to inefficiencies and limitations in how LLMs process and understand non-English text.

### The Challenge of Tokenizing Code

Tokenization also presents unique challenges when dealing with code, such as Python. The way spaces and indentation are handled can significantly impact the model's ability to understand and generate code, highlighting the importance of considering tokenization in the context of programming languages.

### Conclusion

Understanding tokenization is essential for working with large language models. By exploring its complexities, impacts, and the methods used to optimize it, such as byte pair encoding, we gain a deeper insight into the inner workings of LLMs and how they process text data.

Optimizing Token Space in Language Models
-----------------------------------------

In the quest for efficiency within large language models (LLMs), the management of token space emerges as a critical consideration. The transition from GPT-2 to GPT-4 tokenizers showcases a significant leap towards optimizing this space, reducing the token count for identical strings by approximately half.

### The Impact of Tokenizer Choice on Token Count

When comparing tokenizers, a striking difference in efficiency is observed. The GPT-2 tokenizer, for instance, generates a token count of 300 for a specific string. Switching to the GPT-4 tokenizer, labeled as CL 100k base, the token count dramatically drops to 185 for the same string. This reduction is attributed to the GPT-4 tokenizer's larger vocabulary size, approximately doubling that of its predecessor, GPT-2.

[Jump to this part of the video: 01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=4398s)

### Achieving a Denser Input for the Transformer

The densification of input to the transformer is a direct consequence of this reduction in token count. With fewer tokens representing the same amount of text, the transformer can now process a broader context within the same computational constraints. This efficiency is crucial for enhancing the model's ability to predict subsequent tokens based on a more extensive textual context.

### Balancing the Token Vocabulary

However, the expansion of the token vocabulary is not without its challenges. As the number of tokens increases, so does the size of the embedding table and the complexity of the output prediction mechanism, particularly the softmax layer. This necessitates a careful balance, finding a "sweet spot" in the vocabulary size that ensures both density and efficiency in processing.

### Enhanced Handling of White Space in Python Code

A noteworthy improvement in the GPT-4 tokenizer is its handling of white spaces in Python code. By grouping multiple spaces into a single token, the tokenizer significantly enhances the efficiency of representing Python code. This design choice by OpenAI not only densifies the input but also improves the model's performance in code prediction tasks.

<img src="frames/frame_849.jpg" alt=" You see that here these four spaces are represented as one single token for the three spaces here and then the token spaces and here seven spaces were all grouped into a single token" width="450"/>

This strategic grouping of white spaces into fewer tokens exemplifies the thoughtful design considerations that contribute to the overall improvement in LLMs from GPT-2 to GPT-4, beyond mere architectural and optimization tweaks.

### Conclusion

The evolution of tokenizers from GPT-2 to GPT-4 highlights a significant stride towards optimizing token space in LLMs. By efficiently managing token count and improving the handling of specific data types like Python code, these advancements promise a more effective and nuanced approach to text processing and prediction within LLMs.

## Tokenization and Encoding in Language Models
### Understanding the Need for Tokenization

Tokenization is the process of converting strings of text into integers within a fixed vocabulary, which are then used to make lookups into a table of vectors. These vectors are fed into the transformer as input. This process becomes complex when we consider supporting multiple languages and special characters, such as emojis.

<img src="frames/frame_901.jpg" alt=" So remember what we want to do. We want to take strings and feed them into language models" width="450"/>

### The Challenge of Supporting Multiple Languages and Characters

The complexity of tokenization arises from the need to support a wide range of characters found across different languages and on the internet. Unicode code points serve as a universal standard, defining roughly 150,000 characters across 161 scripts. However, directly using Unicode code points for tokenization is not practical due to the vast vocabulary size and the evolving nature of the Unicode standard.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=953s)

### Exploring Unicode and Encodings

Unicode code points are a way to represent characters from various languages and scripts. Python's `ORD` function can be used to find the code point of a character. However, the direct use of Unicode code points is inefficient due to the large vocabulary size. Instead, encodings like UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are used to translate Unicode text into binary data or byte streams, with UTF-8 being the most common due to its variable length encoding and compatibility with ASCII.

<img src="frames/frame_961.jpg" alt=" So Unicode code points are defined by the Unicode consortium as part of the Unicode standard" width="450"/>

### The Role of UTF-8 Encoding

UTF-8 encoding translates Unicode code points into a byte stream, which can range from one to four bytes per code point. This encoding is preferred for its efficiency and compatibility with ASCII. However, using UTF-8 naively would result in a small vocabulary size and inefficiently long sequences for language models.

### Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) Algorithm

To address the limitations of using raw UTF-8 byte streams, the Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm is employed. BPE compresses byte sequences by iteratively finding and replacing the most frequent pairs of bytes with a new token, thereby reducing the sequence length while expanding the vocabulary in a controlled manner. This method allows for efficient encoding of text into tokens that can be used by language models.

<img src="frames/frame_1431.jpg" alt=" So as I mentioned the byte pair encoding algorithm is not all that complicated" width="450"/>

### Implementing Byte Pair Encoding

The implementation of BPE involves encoding text into UTF-8, converting bytes to integers, and then applying the BPE algorithm to iteratively compress the byte sequences. This process involves identifying the most common pairs of bytes, replacing them with a new token, and repeating the process to gradually reduce the sequence length and adjust the vocabulary size.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=1867s)

### Practical Application of BPE

A practical example of applying BPE is demonstrated by encoding a paragraph into UTF-8, identifying the most common byte pairs, and iteratively merging them to compress the sequence. This process is repeated until a desired vocabulary size or sequence length is achieved, showcasing the effectiveness of BPE in preparing text for language models.

<img src="frames/frame_1625.jpg" alt=" So here's what i did i went to this blog post that i enjoyed and i took the first paragraph" width="450"/>

### Conclusion

The process of tokenization, particularly through the use of the Byte Pair Encoding algorithm, is essential for efficiently preparing text for language models. By understanding and implementing BPE, developers can effectively manage the challenges of supporting multiple languages and characters, ensuring that language models can process text data effectively.

Optimizing Vocabulary Size for Efficiency
-----------------------------------------

Finding the ideal vocabulary size is crucial for the efficiency of tokenization in large language models. A larger vocabulary can reduce the sequence length but requires careful tuning to find the optimal balance. GPT-4, for example, utilizes a vocabulary of approximately 100,000 tokens, demonstrating the scale at which modern models operate.

<img src="frames/frame_2073.jpg" alt=" The more steps we take, the larger will be our vocabulary, and the shorter will be our sequence" width="450"/>

Advanced Tokenization Techniques
--------------------------------

### Iterative Byte-Pair Encoding

To refine our tokenizer, we employ an iterative process known as Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE), which allows for more representative statistics and sensible results by analyzing longer texts. This method involves encoding text into bytes, then iteratively merging the most common byte pairs to reduce the overall sequence length while expanding the vocabulary.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=2109s)

### Setting the Final Vocabulary Size

Determining the final vocabulary size is a critical step in the tokenization process, acting as a hyperparameter that influences the tokenizer's performance. For our example, we aim for a vocabulary size of 276 tokens, achieved through 20 specific merges, starting from an initial set of 256 byte tokens.

<img src="frames/frame_2170.jpg" alt=" So let's say for us, we're going to use 276 because that way we're going to be doing exactly 20 merges" width="450"/>

### The Process of Merging Tokens

The merging process involves identifying the most common pairs of tokens and combining them into a new token, effectively reducing the total number of tokens while maintaining the ability to represent the original text. This process is repeated iteratively, with each new token becoming eligible for further merging, thereby creating a more efficient encoding scheme.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=2266s)

Evaluating Compression Efficiency
---------------------------------

After completing the specified number of merges, it's essential to assess the tokenizer's efficiency by examining the compression ratio achieved. This ratio indicates how effectively the tokenizer can reduce the size of the original text, with a higher ratio signifying greater efficiency. In our example, a compression ratio of approximately 1.27 was achieved after 20 merges.

<img src="frames/frame_2324.jpg" alt=" One thing we can take a look at as well is we can take a look at the compression ratio that we've achieved" width="450"/>

Training the Tokenizer: A Separate Preprocessing Stage
------------------------------------------------------

### The Role of the Tokenizer

The tokenizer serves as a distinct preprocessing stage, separate from the training of the large language model itself. It is responsible for converting raw text into a sequence of tokens and vice versa, facilitating the model's ability to process and understand the text.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=606s)

### Importance of a Dedicated Training Set

For optimal performance, the tokenizer may require a different training set than the large language model, encompassing a variety of languages and data types. This diversity ensures that the tokenizer can effectively handle different kinds of text, resulting in more efficient tokenization and, consequently, better model performance.

<img src="frames/frame_2503.jpg" alt=" So for example, when you're training the tokenizer, as I mentioned, we don't just care about the performance of English text" width="450"/>

Encoding and Decoding with the Trained Tokenizer
-------------------------------------------------

### The Process of Decoding

Decoding is the process of converting a sequence of tokens back into the original text. This step is crucial for understanding the output of the language model and for further processing or analysis of the generated text.

## Crafting a Custom Vocabulary for Tokenization
### Understanding the Vocabulary Creation Process

Creating a custom vocabulary is a pivotal step in the tokenization process for large language models. This involves mapping token IDs to their corresponding byte objects, starting with the raw bytes for tokens from 0 to 255 and then incorporating all merges in a sorted manner. This method ensures a comprehensive bytes representation of tokens, crucial for effective tokenization.

<img src="frames/frame_2932.jpg" alt=" So there are many different ways to do it.Here's one way" width="450"/>

### The Importance of Python Version in Tokenization

It's essential to note the significance of using modern Python versions, specifically Python 3.7 and above, for tokenization tasks. These versions guarantee the order of items in a dictionary, which is critical for the correct iteration and insertion of elements into the merges dictionary during the vocabulary creation process.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=2656s)

## Handling Token Encoding and Decoding
### Converting Token IDs to Text

The process of converting token IDs back into readable text involves looking up their byte representations in the vocabulary, concatenating these bytes, and then decoding them back into Python strings using UTF-8. This step is crucial for transforming the raw bytes into a format that can be easily understood and utilized.

<img src="frames/frame_2686.jpg" alt=" And then here, this is one way in Python to concatenate all these bytes together to create our tokens" width="450"/>

### Addressing UTF-8 Decoding Errors

A common challenge in tokenization is handling invalid UTF-8 byte sequences, which can result in decoding errors. To overcome this, it's recommended to use the `errors=replace` option in the `bytes.decode` function, which substitutes invalid byte sequences with a special replacement character. This approach ensures that the decoding process is robust and can handle any anomalies in the token IDs.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=2831s)

## Implementing Token Encoding
### Encoding Strings into Token IDs

The final step in the tokenization process is encoding strings back into token IDs. This involves creating a function that takes a string as input and outputs a list of integers representing the token IDs. This function is essential for converting text data into a format that can be processed by large language models.

<img src="frames/frame_2907.jpg" alt=" So we are going to implement this error right here, where we are going to be given a string, and we want to encode it into tokens" width="450"/>

Advanced Tokenization Techniques
--------------------------------

In this section, we delve into a more sophisticated approach to tokenization, moving beyond the basics to explore how encoding and merging strategies can enhance the process for large language models.

### Encoding Text into UTF-8 Bytes

The initial step in this advanced tokenization process involves encoding the text into UTF-8, converting it into a series of raw bytes. This method provides a foundation by transforming the text into a more manageable form for further processing.

<img src="frames/frame_2940.jpg" alt=" So this is one of the ways that I came up with. So the first thing we're going to do is we are going to take our text, encode it into UTF-8 to get the raw bytes." width="450"/>

### Utilizing a Merges Dictionary

Following the encoding, the process utilizes a merges dictionary to identify and combine specific byte pairs. This dictionary is crucial for determining which bytes can be merged based on their occurrence and relevance within the text.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=2963s)

### Sequential Merging Based on Precedence

An essential aspect of this tokenization method is the sequential merging of bytes, adhering to a predefined order. This ensures that merges are performed logically, respecting the hierarchical structure of the merges dictionary.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=2973s)

### Identifying Merge Candidates

To efficiently merge byte pairs, the process involves identifying potential candidates for merging. This is achieved by analyzing the sequence of tokens and utilizing statistical methods to pinpoint pairs that are eligible for merging.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3044s)

### Implementing a Min Function for Optimal Merging

A sophisticated technique employed in this process is the use of a `min` function to determine the most suitable pair for merging. This approach ensures that the merging sequence is optimized, focusing on pairs that align with the merges dictionary's order.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3076s)

### Handling Non-Mergable Pairs

An important consideration in this tokenization method is the handling of byte pairs that cannot be merged. By assigning an infinite value to non-mergable pairs, the process effectively excludes them from the merging candidates, ensuring a smooth and logical merging sequence.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3166s)

### Potential Challenges and Solutions

While this advanced tokenization technique offers significant benefits, it's crucial to be aware of potential challenges. One such challenge is the possibility of the merging function failing under certain conditions. Understanding and addressing these challenges is key to implementing a robust tokenization process.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3185s)

Understanding the Merging Process in Tokenization
-------------------------------------------------

In the journey of tokenization, a critical step involves identifying and merging pairs of tokens based on specific criteria. This process is essential for reducing the complexity of the data and making it more manageable for language models.

### The Challenge of Finding Mergeable Pairs

The algorithm seeks pairs that can be merged, but it encounters a significant hurdle when no pairs meet the merging criteria. This situation is indicated by all pairs evaluating to `float infs` for the merging criterion, leading to a scenario where the algorithm cannot proceed with any merges.

<img src="frames/frame_3193.jpg" alt=" If there's nothing to merge, then there's nothing in merges that is satisfied anymore" width="450"/>

### Breaking Out When No Merges Are Possible

A crucial part of the process is identifying when no further merges can be made. This is detected when a pair, not in the `merges` dictionary, becomes the first element in `stats` by default, signaling that merging cannot continue. At this point, the algorithm will break out of the loop, concluding that no additional pairs can be merged.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3229s)

### Implementing the Merge

When a mergeable pair is found, the algorithm proceeds to merge it. This involves looking up the pair in the `mergers` dictionary to find its index and then replacing every occurrence of the pair in the tokens list with this index. This step is repeated until no more pairs can be merged, effectively simplifying the token list.

<img src="frames/frame_3261.jpg" alt=" So we're going to look into the mergers dictionary for that pair to look up the index" width="450"/>

### Handling Special Cases

The implementation also needs to account for special cases, such as when the token list contains a single character or is empty. In these scenarios, the `stats` list would be empty, causing issues with the merging process. To address this, the algorithm includes a condition to return early if the length of the tokens is less than two, thereby avoiding errors related to empty or singular token lists.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3323s)

By understanding these steps and challenges, we gain insight into the complexities of the tokenization process and the intricate details involved in preparing data for language models.

Exploring Tokenization and Its Complexities
-------------------------------------------

In this section, we delve into the intricacies of tokenization, a fundamental process in the operation of large language models (LLMs). Tokenization is not just about converting text into tokens; it's about understanding the nuances that come with encoding and decoding text, ensuring the integrity of the data throughout the process.

### The Basics of Encoding and Decoding

Tokenization involves two primary processes: encoding and decoding. Encoding transforms a string of text into a sequence of tokens, while decoding attempts to revert tokens back to the original text. However, it's crucial to note that decoding doesn't always guarantee a perfect return to the original string due to the limitations in token sequences being valid UTF-8 byte streams.

<img src="frames/frame_3346.jpg" alt=" Okay, and then second, I have a few test cases here for us as well" width="450"/>

### Byte Pair Encoding: A Closer Look

Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) is a tokenization strategy that builds a dictionary of merges from a training set, creating a binary forest atop raw bytes. This method allows for efficient encoding and decoding between raw text and token sequences, laying the groundwork for more advanced tokenization techniques used in state-of-the-art LLMs.

### Advancing to State-of-the-Art Tokenizers

As we transition from basic tokenization methods to those employed by leading-edge LLMs, the complexity of the process increases significantly. We begin this exploration by examining the GPT series, specifically focusing on the tokenizer used in GPT-2.

#### GPT-2 and Byte-Pair Encoding

GPT-2 utilizes the byte-pair encoding algorithm, but with a twist. It applies a more sophisticated approach to avoid unnecessary merges, such as combining frequently occurring words with punctuation. This method aims to separate semantics from punctuation, enhancing the model's understanding of text.

<img src="frames/frame_3459.jpg" alt=" So let's kick things off by looking at the GPT series" width="450"/>

#### Enforcing Merging Rules

To refine the tokenization process, GPT-2 introduces manual rules to prevent certain types of characters from merging. This top-down approach ensures that the tokenizer maintains a clear distinction between different elements of the text, optimizing the model's performance.

### GPT-2 Tokenizer Implementation

A deep dive into GPT-2's tokenizer reveals the intricacies of its implementation. Despite being named `encoder.py`, this script encompasses both encoding and decoding functionalities, highlighting the tokenizer's critical role in the model's architecture.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3569s)

This exploration of tokenization, from its basic principles to its application in cutting-edge LLMs like GPT-2, underscores the importance of this process in the development and operation of language models. By understanding and refining tokenization, researchers and developers can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of LLMs.

Exploring Advanced Tokenization Techniques
------------------------------------------

Tokenization is a fundamental step in preparing text for processing by large language models (LLMs). It involves breaking down text into manageable pieces, known as tokens, which the model can interpret. This section delves into the complexities of tokenization, highlighting the use of regular expressions (regex) to enforce specific tokenization rules.

### Understanding Regex in Tokenization

Regex patterns play a crucial role in defining how text should be tokenized. They allow for the specification of rules that determine which parts of the text should not be merged, ensuring more precise tokenization.

<img src="frames/frame_3595.jpg" alt="They create a regex pattern here that looks very complicated, and we're going to go through it in a bit." width="450"/>

#### The Power of the `regex` Package

It's important to distinguish between the standard Python `re` module and the `regex` package. The latter is an extension that offers more capabilities and is essential for complex tokenization tasks.

[Jump to this part of the video: 01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3618s)

### Breaking Down the Regex Pattern

The regex pattern used in advanced tokenization can seem daunting at first glance. However, understanding its components reveals how it effectively separates text into tokens.

<img src="frames/frame_3631.jpg" alt="So let's take a look at this pattern and what it's doing and why this is actually doing the separation that they are looking for." width="450"/>

#### How the Pattern Works

The pattern is designed to match specific sequences in the text, using a combination of raw strings and logical ORs (`|`). This approach allows it to identify and separate different elements within the text, such as words from spaces or punctuation.

[Jump to this part of the video: 01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3646s)

### Practical Application: Tokenizing a String

To see the regex pattern in action, we apply it to an example string. This demonstrates how the pattern matches different parts of the text, effectively breaking it down into tokens.

<img src="frames/frame_3646.jpg" alt="So what exactly is this doing? Well, re.findall will take this pattern and try to match it against this string." width="450"/>

#### The Outcome of Tokenization

By applying the regex pattern to a sample string, we can observe how it successfully identifies and separates words. This process is crucial for feeding accurately tokenized text into an LLM like GPT-2.

Advanced Tokenization Techniques
--------------------------------

Tokenization is not just about converting text into tokens; it's about intelligently splitting text to ensure that the model processes it in the most efficient and accurate way possible. This section delves into the sophisticated methods used to split text before it undergoes tokenization, highlighting the importance of this preliminary step.

<img src="frames/frame_3781.jpg" alt=" Now, what is this doing and why is this important?" width="450"/>

### Splitting Text for Better Tokenization

The process begins by dividing the text into a list of smaller text elements. Each element is then tokenized independently, and the resulting sequences of tokens are concatenated. This method ensures that certain combinations of characters, such as a letter followed by a space, are never merged, maintaining the integrity of the tokenization process.

[Jump to this part of the video: 00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3589s)

### Utilizing Regex for Text Segmentation

Regular expressions (regex) play a crucial role in segmenting text into manageable pieces. By applying specific regex patterns, the tokenizer can separate letters, numbers, and punctuation, preventing unwanted merges during the tokenization process. This technique is essential for maintaining the granularity of the tokenized text.

<img src="frames/frame_3874.jpg" alt=" So basically using this regex pattern to chunk up the text is just one way of enforcing that some merges are not to happen" width="450"/>

#### Handling Numeric Characters

The tokenizer uses the `\p{n}` pattern to identify numeric characters across various scripts, ensuring that numbers are treated as distinct entities. This separation is vital for correctly processing text that includes both letters and numbers.

[Jump to this part of the video: 01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=3897s)

#### Dealing with Apostrophes

Apostrophes present a unique challenge in tokenization. The tokenizer includes specific patterns to identify common apostrophes, separating them from adjacent letters. However, issues arise with Unicode apostrophes, which are not always correctly segmented, demonstrating the complexities of tokenization.

<img src="frames/frame_3926.jpg" alt=" Let's see how these apostrophes work" width="450"/>

This advanced approach to tokenization, involving text splitting and the use of regex, underscores the intricate processes required to prepare text for large language models. By understanding these techniques, developers can better manage the challenges of tokenization, ensuring that their models process text as accurately as possible.

=======================================================

Tokenization Challenges and Solutions
-------------------------------------

Tokenization in GPT models involves complex patterns and rules to effectively separate text into tokens. This process is crucial for the model's understanding and processing of text data. One notable challenge is handling apostrophes in different cases, which can lead to inconsistent tokenization.

<img src="frames/frame_3989.jpg" alt=" And so it's basically hard-coded for this specific kind of apostrophe, and otherwise they become completely separate tokens." width="450"/>

GPT-2 Documentation Insights
----------------------------

The GPT-2 documentation highlights the importance of considering case sensitivity in tokenization patterns. The absence of `re.ignorecase` results in different tokenization outcomes for uppercase and lowercase versions of words with apostrophes, demonstrating the nuanced nature of tokenization rules.

[Jump to this part of the video: 01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zduSFxRajkE&t=4002s)

Language-Specific Tokenization Issues
-------------------------------------

Tokenization rules can also be language-specific, leading to inconsistencies when dealing with languages that use apostrophes differently. This highlights the challenge of creating a universally effective tokenizer across different languages.

<img src="frames/frame_4002.jpg" alt=" In addition to this, you can go to the GPT-2 docs, and here when they define the pattern, they say, should have added re.ignore case, so BP mergers can happen for capitalized versions of contractions." width="450"/>

Regex Patterns in Tokenization

Exploring Unstable Tokens in Language Models
--------------------------------------------

Language models can sometimes exhibit unexpected and erratic behaviors when encountering certain inputs. This phenomenon is often due to what are termed "unstable tokens," which can lead to a range of issues from the model predicting end-of-text prematurely to flagging inputs as policy violations.

### The Challenge of Partial Tokens

Partial tokens present a significant challenge in language processing. These occur when the model encounters fragments of tokens or incomplete character sequences that it fails to recognize based on its training data. This unfamiliarity can cause the model to react unpredictably, a situation colloquially described as the model feeling "jank."

### Advanced Tokenization Techniques

Addressing the issue of unstable tokens requires sophisticated tokenization strategies. Instead of merely appending the next full token after a partial token sequence, a more nuanced approach involves considering a range of potential characters that, upon re-tokenization, would have a high probability of being the correct continuation. This method, however, is complex and highlights the intricate challenges inherent in tokenization.

Exploring the Quirks of Tokenization in Language Models
-------------------------------------------------------

Tokenization plays a pivotal role in the functionality of large language models (LLMs), often leading to unexpected behaviors due to the nuances in its implementation. This section delves into a specific instance highlighting the importance of understanding tokenization's impact on LLMs.

### The Case of the "sold gold Magikarp"
<img src="frames/frame_347.jpg" alt=" Well this again comes down to tokenization" width="450"/>

A curious case emerged involving a Reddit user known as "sold gold Magikarp." This example illustrates how discrepancies between the tokenization dataset and the training dataset can lead to unforeseen model behavior. The tokenization process identified "sold gold Magikarp" as a frequently occurring string, assigning it a unique token within the model's vocabulary. However, this token was absent from the training data used to refine the model, resulting in an "untrained" token that, when invoked, could lead to unpredictable outcomes.

### Untrained Tokens and Undefined Behavior
The phenomenon of untrained tokens, akin to unallocated memory in programming, underscores the challenges in managing LLMs' vocabularies. When such tokens are activated, they extract an untrained row from the embedding table, introducing undefined behavior into the model's output. This scenario emphasizes the critical nature of aligning tokenization and training datasets to ensure model reliability.

<img src="frames/frame_7736.jpg" alt=" And then at test time, if you evoke this token, then you're basically plucking out a row of the embedding table that is completely untrained" width="450"/>

### Tokenization Efficiency Across Formats
The efficiency of tokenization can vary significantly across different data formats, impacting the model's performance and cost-effectiveness. A comparison between JSON and YAML demonstrates this variability, with YAML proving to be more token-efficient. This insight is valuable for optimizing the processing of structured data, encouraging the selection of formats that minimize token usage and, by extension, computational resources.
